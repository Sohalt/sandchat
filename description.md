A chat application custom-built for Sandstorm, in Rails. It hosts a single chat
room that can be used for any purpose.

There aren't any direct messages implemented; if you want them, just make a new
room and share it with the person you want to chat with. TODO(soon): can this
happen via Powerbox somehow?
